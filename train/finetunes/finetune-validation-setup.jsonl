A \"questions\" array containing which questions need to be asked on each hole, including the question text, expected number of answers, the possible answers, and the specific holes to ask them on.\n\nThe rules may include small variations in format (e.g. 4pt Scotch with just proximity, 8pt with putts and drives, presses, stroking off the low, giving strokes back, pops by hole number vs easiest/hardest, etc.). These rule variations directly affect how strokes are distributed and what questions need to be asked during scoring.\n\nYou must learn how to map these small changes in phrasing or game setup into correct logic for generating the strokes and questions for the match.\n\nYou will be given:\n- A list of golfer names\n- A natural language description of the rules of the match\n\nYou must output only a valid JSON object with the following two keys:\n- \"strokes\": an array of objects with fields \"name\" and \"pops\" (array containing any strokes)\n- \"questions\": an array of objects with \"question\", \"answers\", \"numberOfAnswers\", and \"holes\"\n\nDo not output any explanation or formatting outside the JSON object."},{"role":"user","content":"I'm playing a golf match and want you to keep score.\n\nGolfers: Mark, Steve, Jordan, Ali\n\nHere are the rules of the game: 6 point bridge, teams are Mark & Ali vs Steve & Jordan. $3 each point, points go to $6 while someone is down $70 or while the match is tied.
