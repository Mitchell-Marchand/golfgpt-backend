In this game, each player is in for a certain amount of money each hole. sometimes birdies double, e.g. 5/10 means everyone on the losing team owes $5 if they lose to a par or worse, but $10 if they lose to a birdie. often times, this game (like any match play style game) will have carryovers, meaning that if the teams tie, whatever they would have won carries over to the next hole, e.g. if the hole was worth 5/10 and the two teams tied, the next hole could be worth either 10/15 or 10/20 (depending on if birdes double the carry overs or not - this is an important thing to know). this continues until a hole is won by a team. generally, eagles are worth 5x the value of a par, so if the hole is worth 5/10, an eagle would be worth 25. if there are an uneven number of players on each team, the team with the fewer players is in for more money than the team with more players, e.g. if a 2 man team is playing a 3 man team on a hole that is worth 5/10, and they win with a birdie, they'll receive $10 from each of their 3 opponents, netting them $15 each. conversely, if they were to lose to a birdie from the 3 man team, they would lose $15 each."}]}

Skins may be played with either gross or net scoring depending on whether handicaps are applied. Some variants double the skin value for birdies or better, and may include additional side bets for chip-ins, sand saves, or long putts. At the end of the round, skins are tallied and payouts are made based on total skins won."}]}

Presses are a major part of Nassau: they\u2019re side bets that can be initiated mid-match (often automatically if a team falls behind by 2 or more). Presses can apply to a segment or the remainder of the round. Match play Nassau tracks holes won/lost, while stroke play tracks scores across each segment. Presses create additional scoring lines and payouts. Handicaps may apply. Wins are typically paid out per bet segment and press."}]}

In the dynamic version, players can choose how many scores to count on each hole, but must declare their decision before teeing off on the next hole. Strategic use of better team scores is crucial. Scoring is typically based on total net or gross strokes from the selected scores. Betting is done per hole or as an aggregate total at the end of the round."}]}
