        "Game rules": "team a plays against team b. sometimes there are handicaps involved, but usually it's not a thing. it is a game of points, and there are 4 types of points: lowest individual score, lowest team score, closest to the pin in regulation, and birdies. each point is worth the same dollar value, which the group decides upon at the beginning of the round. sometimes this dollar value can change mid round, e.g. once the back 9 starts, once a team goes down by $30 or more, etc.. the point value can also double if a team decides to hammer/soup/bridge - or in other words - double it after watching their opponents tee off. if team a watches team b tee off and doubles it, team b have the option to double it again after they see team a tee off (making it quadruple the value that it would have been otherwise). if a team sweeps by getting all 4 points, i.e. at least one member of the team made a birdie, one member of the team had the lowest individual score of the group, the partners combined had a lower score than their opponents combined, and at least 1 member from the team was closest to the pin in regulation, AND the opponents did not also have a birdie (these would cancel out), that also doubles the value of a hole. additionally, it is possible for a team to get 2 points for proximity, i.e. they were both closer to the pin than their opponents in regulation. it is ALSO possible for both players on a team to birdie. for each additional birdie made by a team, the point value doubles. eagles count as two birdies, and double eagles (albatrosses) count as 3 birdies, e.g. an eagle and a birdie count as 3 birdies for the team."

        "Game rules": "team a plays against team b. the scoring is simple: you create a multi-digit number for each team based on the scores of the golfers on that team, where the lowest score is the first digit, the second lowest is the second digit, and so on. if team a makes a birdie, and team b doesn't, the scores for team b flip to where their multi-digit number starts with their highest score, then their second highest score, and so on. the value that a player wins/loses on each hole is determined by their team's multi-digit number, e.g. if the two players on team a make a 3 (birdie) and a 4, and the players on team b make a 4 and a 5, team a's multi digit number is 34 and team b's gets flipped to 54 (because team a made a birdie). in this scenario, team a wins $20 per person, because their 34 is 20 less than 54. birdies on opposing teams cancel out in most games, so there is no flip."

        "Names of the game": ["Right Left", "2 right 2 left", "3 right 2 left", "2 right 3 left", "1 center"],
        "Game rules": "Right Left is pretty simple. each golfer in the group tees off, and the teams are determined by where their ball lands relative to the center of the fairway (or green on a par 3). In this game, each player is in for a certain amount of money each hole. sometimes birdies double, e.g. 5/10 means everyone on the losing team owes $5 if they lose to a par or worse, but $10 if they lose to a birdie. often times, this game (like any match play style game) will have carryovers, meaning that if the teams tie, whatever they would have won carries over to the next hole, e.g. if the hole was worth 5/10 and the two teams tied, the next hole could be worth either 10/15 or 10/20 (depending on if birdes double the carry overs or not - this is an important thing to know). this continues until a hole is won by a team. generally, eagles are worth 5x the value of a par, so if the hole is worth 5/10, an eagle would be worth 25. if there are an uneven number of players on each team, the team with the fewer players is in for more money than the team with more players, e.g. if a 2 man team is playing a 3 man team on a hole that is worth 5/10, and they win with a birdie, they'll receive $10 from each of their 3 opponents, netting them $15 each. conversely, if they were to lose to a birdie from the 3 man team, they would lose $15 each."

        "Names of the game": ["Flip Wolf"],
        "Game rules": "In flip wolf, everyone flips a coin to determine teams. heads are with heads, and tails are with tails. if everyone flips the same side, everyone plays against everyone - no teams - and whatever the bet is automatically doubles. same rules as right-left or other dynamic team games for determining carryovers, hole values, who owes who what, and so on."

    {
        "Names of the game": ["Wolf"],
        "Game rules": "In wolf, the order that golfers tee off is established on the tee box, and it rotates each hole, i.e. if player A first one hole 1, they are the wolf, and they go last on hole 2 (on hole 2, whomever went 2nd on hole one goes first, and so-on). when the wolf tees off (whomever tees off first is the wolf), they have an option: they can double the bet and play against the rest of the group by themselves. or they can watch the drives of the other players in the group and pick a partner after seeing the tee shots. from there, the teams are set, and the money value works like in flip wolf or right-left."
